# MyReads - React App Project

## Overview:

This app was created as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The goal of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of how to build a React app using a starter template that consists of a basic HTML and CSS structure provided by Udacity. 

## To Get Started:

Run ```git clone git@github.com:dkwan29/react-project-myreads.git``` to clone the repo

Go into proper directory using ```cd ...directorynamehere```

Install project dependencies ```npm install```

Start development server ```npm start```

Application should run opening a browser window on ```localhost:3000```

## App Functionality:

In this app, the main page displays a list of shelves (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The main page also has a link to a search page on the bottom right. This link takes you to a search page that allows you to find books by entering the name in an input field. Results are generated as you type the name of the book. You can add books from the search to your library using the dropdown menu.
